<br>1.Firstly we made a banner,on banner we set a image,movie title and movie description </br>
<br>2. Than we mmade a navbar where we link movies and favrouies</br>
<br>3.Than we made a list where all films images are there and in list.js we did a pagination also i pagination when we click on next all other film images comes </br>
<br>4.and after that we click on favourite tab where we create two table the first table consist of genre "where all movie genre are presennt" and on second table we create the rating,popularity,movie image and alos a delete button</br>
<br>5.so where all this images comes from this all images comes from "tmdb link" which is in the getmovies.js with the help of these file we can access all movies imfo linke(rating,popularity,images)etc.
